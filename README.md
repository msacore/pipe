# pipe

> **Warning**  
> This module under rapid development

Power of Go channels with io.Pipe usability.
Build multithread tools easily.

- Thread safe
- `io` and `lo` like syntax (Tee, Reduce, Map, etc) but concurrently

## :building_construction: Methods

### [Map](map.go)

![Map](assets/methods/map.svg)

[![Parallel]](#parallel)
[![Sync]](#sync)
[![Sequential]](#sequential)
[![Single]](#single)
[![Same]](#same)

Take message and convert it into another type by map function.
If input channel is closed then output channel is closed.
Creates a new channel with the same capacity as input.

<details> 
  <summary>Usage examples</summary>

```go
// input := make(chan int, 4) with random values.
// Say, the input contains [1, 2, 3]

// Parallel strategy
// Best performance (Multiple goroutines)

output := Map(func(value int) string { 
    fmt.Print(value)
    return fmt.Sprintf("val: %d", value) 
}, input)
// stdout: 2 1 3
// output: ["val: 2", "val: 1", "val: 3"] 

// Sync strategy
// Consistent ordering (Multiple goroutines with sequential output)

output := MapSync(func(value int) string { 
    fmt.Print(value)
    return fmt.Sprintf("val: %d", value) 
}, input)
// stdout: 2 1 3
// output: ["val: 1", "val: 2", "val: 3"] 

// Sequential strategy
// Preventing thread race (Single goroutine)

output := MapSequential(func(value int) string { 
    fmt.Print(value)
    return fmt.Sprintf("val: %d", value) 
}, input)
// stdout: 1 2 3
// output: ["val: 1", "val: 2", "val: 3"] 
```

</details>

### [Wait](wait.go)

Here are 3 helper functions that are waiting for the channels to close.
Each function blocks current goroutine until channels closing condition won't be done.

`Wait(in chan T) chan struct{}` - Waits for the input channel is closed and sends a signal to the returned channel.

```go
<-Wait(input1)
select {
  case <-Wait(input2):
  case <-Wait(input3):
}
// Will executed after input1 closed and input2 or input3 closed
```

`WaitAll(in ...chan T) chan struct{}` - Waits for all input channels are closed, and sends a signal to the returned channel.

```go
<-WaitAll(input1, input2)
// Will executed after input1 AND input2 closed

// It's equal:
<-Wait(input1)
<-Wait(input2)
```

`WaitAny(in ...chan T) chan struct{}` - Waits for one of the input channels are closes, and sends a signal to the returned channel. All other channels are read to the end in the background.

```go
<-WaitAny(input1, input2)
// Will executed after input1 OR input2 closed

// It's equal:
select {
  case <-Wait(input1):
  case <-Wait(input2):
}
```

## :gear: Strategies

Each function has own set of strategies from all categories.
It describes how your channel data `processing`, when channels `closing`, and how calculate `capacity` of output channels.

### :arrows_counterclockwise: Processing

Some functions have different channel processing algorithms. To ensure maximum performance, it is recommended to use the original function. However, specific algorithms can help in cases where you are faced with a race of threads or you need to output data strictly in the same order in which you received them.

#### Parallel

![Parallel]  
Each handler is executed in its own goroutine and there is no guarantee that the output order will be consistent. Recommended for best performance.

#### Sync

![Sync]  
Each handler executes in its own goroutine, but the result of the youngest goroutine waits for the oldest goroutine to finish before being passed to the output stream. To prevent memory leaks, the strategy will wait if there is more waiting data than the capacity of the output channel. Recommended if you want to get the output data in the same order as the input data.

#### Sequential

![Sequential]  
Each handler is executed sequentially, one after the other. Keeps the order of the output data equal to the order of the input data. Recommended if it is necessary to exclude the race of threads between handlers.

### :lock: Closing

Each function has one of several strategies for closing output channels. Understanding will help you understand how and when your pipeline closes.

#### Single

![Single]  
Suitable only for functions with one input. If the input channel is closed, then the output channels are closed.

#### All

![All]  
If all input channels are closed, then the output channels are closed.

#### Any

![Any]  
If one of the input channels is closed, the output channels are closed. All other channels will be read to the end in the background.

### :package: Capacity

Each function creates new output channels with the capacity corresponding to a specific strategy.

#### Same

![Same]  
Suitable only for functions with one input channel. The output channels will have a capacity equal to the input channel.

#### Mult

![Mult] 
Suitable only for functions with one input channel. The output channels will have a capacity equal to the input channel multiplied by N.

#### Min

![Min]  
The output channels will have a capacity equal to the minimum capacity of the input channels.

#### Max

![Max]  
The output channels will have a capacity equal to the maximum capacity of the input channels.

#### Sum

![Sum]  
The output channels will have a capacity equal to the sum of capacities of the input channels.
